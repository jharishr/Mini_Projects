# Vm prediction using Polynomial Regression

This project models the Inverter Switching Voltage Vm as a function of Transistor widths Wp and Wn using Polynomial Regression.

Goal is to find the Wp value that gives Vm = 0.9 V (Vdd/2) using numerical root finding.
The AI-predicted Wp is then compared with the closest value from the raw dataset.
